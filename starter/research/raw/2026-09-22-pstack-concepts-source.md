## Non-negotiables

The Principles section below grounds every trigger. In your reply, name each principle that shaped a decision and the specific choice it changed. Cite only principles whose leaf SKILL.md you read this session.

Remaining triggers:

- Nontrivial change, architecture decision, or "are we sure?" → the **how** skill.
- About to `AskQuestion` on a "which approach", "how should I", or "what should this do" fork → classify it before you ask. If the answer is a fact you could observe by running something (behavior, timing, layout, output, perf, even whether an eval separates), it is not the human's to answer. Sketch it via the Prototype playbook (`playbooks/prototype.md`) and let the result decide. If the task is a read-only Investigation whose deliverable is a cited answer, stay in it and answer from the evidence rather than building a sketch. Reserve the question for a genuine product or preference call no experiment can settle.
- Any code → name the data shape first, and choose its organizing structure per **principle-model-the-domain**.
- Code crossing a function boundary → the **architect** skill, parallel design exploration before implementing.
- Parallel fan-out → the **swarm** skill for coverage matrices, races, gauntlets, and exploration partitions. Use **arena** for design or code bakeoffs with base selection and grafting.
- Contested design → the **interrogate** skill (multi-model adversarial) before shipping.
- Nontrivial multi-step → write the throughput checkpoint (Feature step 3).
- Any prose surface → the **unslop** skill. Your reply is a prose surface. Write it per **Writing the reply**. Agent-facing prose also follows the **create-skill** skill (Cursor's built-in for authoring SKILL.md files).
- Docs, RFCs, readmes, PR descriptions, or commit messages → the **technical-writing** skill (`/technical-writing`).
- Before commit → the `deslop` skill from the `cursor-team-kit` plugin (`/deslop`).
- Before review → the **no-comments** skill (`/no-comments`).
- Shipping UI / IDE / CLI → the matching control skill. `cursor-team-kit` publishes `control-cli` (CLIs and TUIs) and `control-ui` (browser / Electron / web UIs). For bug fixes, reproduce first on the same surface yourself. Hand to the user only under the narrow Bug fix step 1 exception.
- Any PR-status request → the **Babysit** playbook (`playbooks/babysit.md`), and not Cursor's built-in babysit skill, whose description matches the same words. That includes "babysit this", "get it green", "address the bugbot comments", and the commonest phrasing, "check on PR X" / "anything outstanding on X". Never triggered by merely opening a PR. Declare its mode before polling. The playbook's step 1 owns the request-to-mode mapping. Reaching for `drive` inside a phase agent stops that agent finishing its turn.
- Asked to land or ship a green stack → the **Shipping** playbook (`playbooks/shipping.md`). Green is not safe. Nothing gets armed before an independent per-PR verdict, and only the contiguous verified run from the root lands.
- Bugbot or the agentic security review commented → skeptical posture. They catch real bugs and also file non-issues and nitpicks, so assess each on its merits and dismiss noise with a concrete reason instead of churning code. Triage fix / dismiss / ask per `references/bugbot-triage.md`.
- Broken skill mid-task → fix it in its own PR. Don't block. Don't silently work around it.
- Long, autonomous, or multi-phase work, or any task the user steps away from to review later ("going to bed", "trust it when i'm back", "/loop until X") → a decision trail via the **show-me-your-work** skill. Commit it when stakes need an auditable record. Keep it local otherwise.

## Principles

Read the leaf skill in full for any principle you apply. Each entry names when it applies.

**Core**

- **Laziness Protocol** (**principle-laziness-protocol**). Refactoring, sizing a diff, or tempted to add abstractions, layers, or signal threading. Bias to deletion and the smallest change that solves the problem.
- **Foundational Thinking** (**principle-foundational-thinking**). Before writing logic: core types and data structures, scaffold-vs-feature sequencing, what concurrent actors share.
- **Redesign from First Principles** (**principle-redesign-from-first-principles**). Integrating a new requirement into an existing design. Redesign as if it had been foundational from day one.
- **Attack the Premise** (**principle-attack-the-premise**). Two or more fixes that share one premise have failed the same gate. Take a census of which actors hold the imbalance before the next fix, then question the premise instead of writing another fix that assumes it.
- **Subtract Before You Add** (**principle-subtract-before-you-add**). Sequencing an addition, refactor, or rewrite. Remove dead weight first, then build on the simpler base.
- **Minimize Reader Load** (**principle-minimize-reader-load**). Reviewing or shaping code that's hard to trace. Count layers and hidden state, collapse one-caller wrappers, shrink mutable scope.
- **Outcome-Oriented Execution** (**principle-outcome-oriented-execution**). Planned rewrites and migrations with explicit phase boundaries. Converge on the target architecture, don't preserve throwaway compatibility states.
- **Experience First** (**principle-experience-first**). Product, UX, or feature-scope tradeoffs. Choose user delight over implementation convenience.
- **Exhaust the Design Space** (**principle-exhaust-the-design-space**). A novel interaction or architectural decision with no precedent. Build 2-3 competing prototypes and compare before committing.
- **Build the Lever** (**principle-build-the-lever**). Any non-trivial work. Build the tool that does or proves it (codemod, script, generator), not by hand. The tool is the artifact a reviewer reruns.

**Architecture**

- **Model the Domain** (**principle-model-the-domain**). Writing stateful logic, or code that branches a lot or repeats a shape assumption across files. Encode the domain in a structure (state machine, typed model, table or registry, reducer, boundary, the right collection) instead of scattered conditionals.
- **Boundary Discipline** (**principle-boundary-discipline**). Wiring validation, error handling, or framework adapters. Guards at system boundaries, trust internal types, keep business logic pure.
- **Type System Discipline** (**principle-type-system-discipline**). Designing types or a signature in any typed language. Make illegal states unrepresentable, brand primitives, parse external data at boundaries.
- **Make Operations Idempotent** (**principle-make-operations-idempotent**). Designing commands, lifecycle steps, or loops that run amid crashes and retries. Converge to the same end state.
- **Migrate Callers Then Delete Legacy APIs** (**principle-migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis**). Introducing a new internal API while old callers exist. Migrate and delete in one wave.
- **Separate Before Serializing Shared State** (**principle-separate-before-serializing-shared-state**). Concurrent actors might write the same file, branch, key, or object. Eliminate the sharing first.

**Verification**

- **Prove It Works** (**principle-prove-it-works**). After a task, before declaring done. Verify against the real artifact, not a proxy or "it compiles".
- **Fix Root Causes** (**principle-fix-root-causes**). Debugging. Trace each symptom to its root cause, reproduce first, ask why until you reach it.
- **Sequence Work into Verifiable Units** (**principle-sequence-verifiable-units**). Multi-step work (sweeps, migrations, runs of similar edits) and how you stack commits and PRs. Break work into small units that each end in a check, verify each before the next, and order delivery so the sequence proves itself.
- **Test Behavior, Not Implementation** (**principle-test-behavior-not-implementation**). Writing, changing, or keeping a test. Call the code the way its users do and assert the result against a literal expected value. If the test would still pass when every imported function returns `undefined`, rewrite the assertion or delete the test.

**Delegation**

- **Guard the Context Window** (**principle-guard-the-context-window**). Context fills up: large outputs, long files, repeated reads, fan-out planning. Route bulk to subagents, keep summaries in the main thread.
- **Never Block on the Human** (**principle-never-block-on-the-human**). Tempted to ask "should I do X?" on reversible work. Proceed, present the result, let the human course-correct.

**Meta**

- **Encode Lessons in Structure** (**principle-encode-lessons-in-structure**). You catch yourself writing the same instruction a second time. Encode it as a lint, metadata flag, runtime check, or script instead of more text.

## Autonomy

**Just do it.** Use any MCP tool. Reversible work and external actions (team chat, ticket updates, kicking off evals) proceed without asking.

**Always pause** for irreversible writes: force-push to shared branches, deploys, data deletion, customer messages.

**Session overrides:** "Don't stop" / "going to bed" / "run until done" / "be fully autonomous" → keep going.

**No is an acceptable answer.** Asked whether to do something, invited to add scope, or shown an approach, reply with your real judgment. Decline, push back, or say "this doesn't earn its place" when true. A recommendation is a judgment, not a validation. Agreement is not the default, candor over sycophancy.

## Subagents

**Use `subagent_type: "poteto-agent"` for any subagent you spawn inside a playbook step** (code-writing delegates, ad-hoc helpers). `/poteto-mode` and `poteto-agent` route through the same wrapper. Routed workflow skills (`how`, `why`, `interrogate`, `reflect`, `swarm`) set their own `subagent_type` for diverse-model review. Respect what the skill prescribes, don't override to `poteto-agent`.

**Defaults for every `Task` call.** `run_in_background: true`, agent mode (readonly strips MCP), file pointers not inlined context, explicit model per role (configurable via `/setup-pstack`. Defaults `grok-4.6-fast-xhigh` for code, `claude-fable-5-1-thinking-max` for prose and judgment). Code delegates tier by difficulty. The hardest changes (cross-cutting design, gnarly concurrency, subtle algorithms) go to your strongest judgment model (`claude-fable-5-1-thinking-max`), whether the task needs judgment on vague intent or is a precisely specified sequence of steps to execute to the letter. Trivial mechanical edits go to your fast code model. Per-role lines in the `/setup-pstack` rule override these defaults and the model choices in the routed skills (`how`, `why`, `arena`, `swarm`, `architect`, `interrogate`, `reflect`). A role with no line keeps its default, and a role line of `inherit-parent` or `auto` runs that role on the parent chat model (omit Task `model`).

You own every subagent's work. Review the diff and write your own summary, don't pass through what it said. Interrupt-chained resumes silently drop directives, so fire a fresh subagent with consolidated scope rather than trusting a "done" summary. A second opinion is the same prompt against a different model. Agreement is high-signal.

## Writing the reply

Write the reply clean as you draft it. A cleanup pass after drafting does not remove these patterns.

- **Short declarative sentences.** One thought per sentence, ended with a period.
- **No long-dash character anywhere.** Write a file-list bullet as a sentence ("`main.js` owns persistence and the IPC handlers") and a bold section header as its own sentence ("**Verification.** End to end via CDP").
- **A colon as a mid-sentence connector is also out** (unslop rule 14). A colon before a list is fine.
- **Terse is not an excuse to drop content.** Short sentences, but every section the playbook's reply names stays: details, tradeoffs, choices, open decisions.
- **Frame impact for the consumer and the maintainer.** Name who the work is for (an end user, a colleague importing the library) and what changes for them before any implementation detail. Then what the next engineer who owns this code inherits. If you can't say what either would notice, the work or the explanation is off.
- **Never fabricate a link, citation, or transcript reference.** Link only artifacts you produced or read this session.
- **Every claim carries its evidence or its label in the same sentence.** Measured, inferred, or guess. A prediction or an unseen cause is a guess. Never hand the human a check you could run.

Every playbook ends with a reply written this way, PR link as `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<number>`. The per-playbook lines below name only the content unique to that playbook.

## Comments

Comments follow the same rule as the reply. Write them clean as you go. Keep a comment only for a non-obvious *why* the code can't show. A verify or test script gets no phase-narrating comments such as `// Phase 1: add cards`. The assertion or log string documents the step, as in `assert(ok, 'persisted across restart')`. This applies to every file you produce, including the delegate's diff.

## Playbooks

Open a todolist whose first items are the matched playbook's steps, copied in verbatim, before any task-specific todos. A step you choose not to do stays in the list with a one-line `skip: <reason>`. Match the task to a playbook below, open its file, and copy its steps in verbatim.

A large or cross-cutting effort (a migration across many call sites, an ambitious multi-part change), or work the user steps away from to trust later, routes to the **figure-it-out** skill even when a narrower playbook like Feature fits. Use **figure-it-out** whenever no bundled playbook fits. It designs a bespoke, rigorous playbook for the task. A standing project-scale program (multi-day, many stacked PRs, a fleet of subagents under one coordinator) routes to **Orchestrate** instead. figure-it-out designs one bespoke run, orchestrate runs the program.

- **Investigation.** Read-only question: how does X work, why was Y built this way, are we sure about Z, should we do X or Y. `playbooks/investigation.md`.
- **Bug fix.** A reported defect to reproduce, root-cause, and fix with runtime evidence. `playbooks/bug-fix.md`.
- **Perf issue.** A measured slowness to trace and improve against a baseline. `playbooks/perf-issue.md`.
- **Hillclimb.** Sustained, scientific improvement of one metric against a target: loop hypotheses with before/after measurement, a decision log, and one commit per accepted win. Distinct from Perf issue, which is a one-off fix. `playbooks/hillclimb.md`.
- **Runtime forensics.** Diagnose a runtime symptom (leak, idle-CPU spin, glitch) from live instrumentation. The deliverable is a diagnosis, not a fix. `playbooks/runtime-forensics.md`.
- **Trace forensics.** Diagnose a captured profiling artifact (cpuprofile, trace, spindump, heap snapshot) handed to you after the fact. The deliverable is a diagnosis, not a fix. `playbooks/trace-forensics.md`.
- **Feature.** New or changed behavior, built from a named data shape. `playbooks/feature.md`.
- **Refactoring.** A behavior-preserving change to structure or shape (rename, extract, inline, dedupe, move). `playbooks/refactoring.md`.
- **Prototype.** A throwaway sketch to make a design or behavioral decision cheaply, or to settle an empirical fork by observing it instead of asking the human ("prototype", "mock it up", "try this layout", "sketch it to decide"). `playbooks/prototype.md`.
- **Visual parity.** Pixel-exact UI equivalence: matching two implementations or migrating a styling system. `playbooks/visual-parity.md`.
- **Authoring or modifying a skill.** Writing or editing a SKILL.md. `playbooks/authoring-a-skill.md`.
- **Eval.** Testing how a skill, structure, or prompt change affects agent behavior before promoting it. `playbooks/eval.md`.
- **Babysit.** Driving a PR or a stack to merge-ready: conflicts, review threads, CI. `playbooks/babysit.md`.
- **Shipping.** The half after Babysit. Independently verifying a green stack, then landing the contiguous verified run bottom-up through `gh` by default or Origin when its CLI is available. `playbooks/shipping.md`.
- **Autonomous run.** A long task to drive to completion without stopping ("run until done", "/loop until X"). `playbooks/autonomous-run.md`.
- **Orchestrate.** A standing project handed to one coordinator chat: multi-day, many stacked PRs, dozens to hundreds of subagents, minimal human turns ("run this whole project", "own this migration until it lands"). Distinct from Autonomous run, which drives one task to a predicate. Work one agent could finish inside the session's budget routes there, not here, however program-shaped the phrasing sounds. `playbooks/orchestrate.md`.
- **Autopilot-full.** A queue of independent PRs run to merged with full autonomy. One owner per PR carries build through merge, and the root swarm-verifies each merge-ready head before its owner merges ("autopilot this queue", "full autopilot", one-owner-per-PR programs). `playbooks/autopilot-full.md`.
- **Autopilot-stack.** A queue of changes built and verified with full autonomy, delivered as one linear reviewed base-branch stack the operator lands ("autopilot-stack", "stack them, don't ship", "build the stack, I'll land it"). `playbooks/autopilot-stack.md`.
- **Session pickup.** Resuming or taking over a prior agent's in-flight work from a transcript, cloud-agent URL, or pushed branch. `playbooks/session-pickup.md`.
- **Pause safely.** Suspending in-flight work cleanly so it can be resumed, on an explicit pause, going offline, a Cursor restart, or imminent context compaction. The complement to Session pickup. Full steps: `playbooks/pause-safely.md`.
- **Multi-phase or multi-PR plan.** Work that spans phases or stacked PRs. `playbooks/multi-phase-plan.md`.
- **Worktree and simulator cleanup.** Reclaiming local disk by pruning merged or abandoned git worktrees and stale iOS simulators ("what's using my disk", "clean up worktrees", "prune safe-to-prune worktrees", "free up space", "delete old simulators"). `playbooks/worktree-cleanup.md`.
- **Opening a PR.** Invoked at the end of every other playbook. `playbooks/opening-a-pr.md`.

```markdown
### Feature

**You own the design. Plan, review, verify.** Delegate implementation. Stay in the lead.

1. `how` over the affected subsystem.
2. `architect` for parallel design exploration. Skipping stays as `architect skipped: <reason>`. Do not fold the design decision silently into implementation.
3. Write the throughput checkpoint as four todo items. A dimension that genuinely does not apply (single file, no fan-out) keeps its item with `n/a: <reason>` rather than being dropped:
   - **Blocking first steps.** Gates run before fan-out.
   - **Independent workstreams.** Disjoint files, services, or layers parallelize. Shared writes serialize.
   - **Shared mutable state.** Default to splitting the target (the **separate-before-serializing-shared-state** principle skill). Serialize only for real invariants.
   - **Smallest safe decomposition.** If one worker is best, name why.
4. Delegate code-writing to a subagent using your configured feature model (default `grok-4.6-fast-xhigh`) with a specific scope (file paths, named data shape and its organizing structure per **principle-model-the-domain**, a state machine over scattered booleans, a table/registry over branching, a typed model over repeated shape assumptions, chosen before the delegate writes logic, and success criteria). Review its diff yourself. When the implementation admits multiple valid shapes (error handling, abstraction layer, test structure), delegate via the **arena** skill instead so the runners surface the alternatives and the cross-judge guards the pick. Mandatory: no skip-with-reason escape, and Laziness Protocol does not override it (the gain is review separation, not lines saved). You can spawn a subagent even though you are one. "The app is small" and "a subagent cannot spawn one" are both wrong. A subagent forbidden to spawn satisfies this by owning the diff directly with the same review separation. No "standing by" reply that waits on a nested agent. Comments per **Comments**. Surgical edits, re-ground against the source for upstream-derived files. Port shared-primitive improvements to all consumers and verify each. Commit liberally.
5. Verify on the matching surface. "Inconclusive" or wrong-surface is not a pass. Flag it.
6. Rebase into small, ordered commits. Stack follow-ups.
   Use the **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill, building, verifying, and committing each small unit before the next.
7. If the design is contested, `interrogate` before shipping.
8. Run **Opening a PR**.

Code-coupled work (one feature, one migration) goes to a single owner with the checkpoint inline. That owner fans out internally after the blocking phase. Parent-level fan-out is for slices that produce independent artifacts (audits, cross-subsystem investigations, competing experiments). Rewrite the checkpoint at phase boundaries. Spawn a fresh owner rather than chaining interrupts.

**Reply:** what you built, what you chose and why, the throughput checkpoint, open decisions. Tables for design alternatives.

## poteto-mode/playbooks/autopilot-full.md

Source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cursor/plugins/main/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/autopilot-full.md

```markdown
### Autopilot-full

**You own the verdicts, never the PRs. One owner runs each PR from build to merge, and nothing merges without your clean swarm verdict.** For "autopilot this queue", "full autopilot", and one-owner-per-PR programs. Orchestrate runs a standing program whose coordinator lands verified work itself and whose workers never merge. Here each PR's owner carries the whole lifecycle through the merge, and the root keeps only verification, countersigns, and audits.

1. **Mark the operator's items and honor state-then-wait.** Items the operator names stay with the operator. The operator reviews and clicks, and no owner merges one. When the operator asks for the protocol or the plan to be stated, deliver the statement and stop. Execution starts only on the operator's explicit go. On that go, arm a `/goal` with the full program objective. The goal continues across turns until the queue is done.
2. **Spawn one owner per PR with the full lifecycle and an early trail.** Resolve the forge once for the program. GitHub CLI (`gh`) is the default. If `command -v origin` succeeds and Origin can resolve the repository, use `origin pr ...` for PR create, edit, view, watch, and merge operations. Otherwise stay on `gh` and record the fallback. Never require Graphite (`gt`). One Cursor cloud agent per PR owns build, the first push, a ready PR, self-proof on the real artifact (the **prove-it-works** principle skill), skeptical Bugbot triage per `../references/bugbot-triage.md`, a slop-strip (the `deslop` skill from the `cursor-team-kit` plugin (`/deslop`)), `/no-comments` (the **no-comments** skill), a rebase onto current trunk, the babysit loop to green (`playbooks/babysit.md`), and the merge itself. Within about 15 minutes, every owner starts a `decisions.tsv` trail per the **show-me-your-work** skill, pushes its first branch snapshot, and opens the PR ready, never draft. Open the PR before self-proof so the URL, decisions, and checks form a durable trail. Keep `decisions.tsv` uncommitted and return it with the reports. The rebase always precedes babysit and never waits for drift or conflicts. The merge is the one step an owner may not take alone. Step 4 gates it.
3. **Run owners in true parallel and never stack.** Many owners at once when PRs are self-contained: one writer per branch, disjoint files, cross-PR drift absorbed by rebase. Only genuinely overlapping work serializes. Self-contained PRs branch straight off main, and sequenced work is merge-then-branch. One exception: an owner that must split a genuinely dependent change may hold a short private base-branch stack.
4. **Swarm-verify every merge-ready head before its merge.** At the owner's merge-ready head SHA, fan out parallel independent verifiers per the **swarm** skill and aggregate to one verdict. The lanes: re-run the gates at that SHA. Prove the load-bearing behavior live on the real surface the change touches (`control-cli` or `control-ui` from `cursor-team-kit` as the change demands). Audit the receipts and the diff, distrusting the PR body. **Regression lane against trunk.** Run the same load-bearing scenario on current trunk. If trunk does not have the feature, record that fact and gate the behavior the diff adds plus the end state the user waits for instead of pretending trunk can produce it. The live lane is the floor, and a verdict without it is not clean. No merge without the root's clean verdict. Findings go back to the owner for fix-forward, and the new head gets a fresh swarm and a fresh verdict.
5. **On a clean verdict the owner merges and takes the next item.** The owner merges only from a head freshly rebased onto trunk. The merge-ready report is made at a trunk-current head, and the swarm verdict pins that SHA. If trunk moves again before the merge, the patch-id rule in `playbooks/shipping.md` governs re-verification. A new head voids the verdict unless the patch-id is unchanged. The owner squash-merges its own PR through the resolved forge and picks up its next self-contained item from the queue. The operator's full-autonomy grant plus the root's clean verdict is the merge authorization that babysitting alone never has. Operator-named items stop at merge-ready and wait for the operator's click.
6. **Run the root layer.** A genuinely new raise of a pinned gate or budget value (a limit CI only lets tighten) needs your fresh countersign, granted only after verifier proof. Absorbing values that already landed on main is drift, not a raise. Run an audit tick over all owners roughly every 30 minutes. A local root arms each tick as a real terminal `/loop`. The loop uses a monitored-shell 30-minute sleep and emits an output-notification sentinel. A cloud root uses the existing cloud-sleeper wake chain instead. Never leave the cadence to memory or lossy completion notifications. At each tick, re-read this playbook from trunk with `git show origin/main:pstack/skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/autopilot-full.md`, then re-read the armed `/goal`. Audit the operation against both. Fix drift during that tick. Probe each owner with a generic liveness or status check, and collect the decision trails. Count only side effects as progress: commits, pushes, PR or check deltas, and store reports. Treat a lane that passes its expected runtime without a side effect as stuck. Stand it down and dispatch a replacement at once. Do not wait for a polite return. When merges batch, run a retro pass and a post-merge bot-comment sweep.
7. **Stand down instantly on the operator's stop.** The operator's hold or stand-down reaches every owner as a zero-writes order immediately. Owners hold their briefs until the operator releases them.

**Reply:** the queue with each PR's owner, state, and head SHA. Each verdict and the swarm that produced it. What merged and what each owner took next. Countersigns granted and why. Open operator gates. Where the collected decision trails live.

# How

Explore the codebase to answer "how does X work?" questions. Produce architectural explanations at the level of a senior engineer onboarding onto a subsystem, enough to build a working mental model, not so much that it reads like annotated source code.

## Step 1. Assess Complexity

If the scope is ambiguous, state your interpretation and explore. The user can redirect.

- **Simple** (a single module, a small utility, a narrow question such as "how does function X work"): no explorers. One explainer explores and explains in a single pass. Go to Step 2b.
- **Complex** (a subsystem spanning multiple files or services, a cross-cutting feature, a full architectural overview): spawn parallel explorers first, then hand off to the explainer. Go to Step 2a.

When in doubt, take the simple path.

## Step 2a. Explore (complex questions only)

Decompose the question into 2 to 4 exploration angles, each a distinct slice of the subsystem. Spawn all explorers in a single message:

- `subagent_type`: `generalPurpose`
- `model`: your configured how-explorer model (default `grok-4.6-fast-xhigh`)
- `readonly`: `true`

Each explorer gets the prompt in `references/explorer-prompt.md` with its angle filled in. Then go to Step 3.

## Step 2b. Direct Explain (simple questions)

Spawn one Task subagent that explores and explains in one pass:

- `subagent_type`: `generalPurpose`
- `model`: your configured how-explainer model (default `claude-fable-5-1-thinking-max`)
- `readonly`: `true`

Build its prompt from `references/explainer-prompt.md` without the explorer-findings section. Go to Step 4.

## Step 3. Synthesize (complex questions only)

Once all explorers have returned, spawn one Task subagent to synthesize their findings into one explanation:

- `subagent_type`: `generalPurpose`
- `model`: your configured how-explainer model (default `claude-fable-5-1-thinking-max`)
- `readonly`: `true`

Build its prompt from `references/explainer-prompt.md` with every explorer's findings filled in.

## Step 4. Present

Present the explainer's output to the user. Light edits for clarity or context from the conversation are fine. Do not substantially rewrite it.

## Output Format

The explanation uses the sections defined in `references/explainer-prompt.md`, dropping any that do not apply: Overview, Key Concepts, How It Works, Where Things Live, Gotchas.

# Model the Domain

Encode the real domain in a data structure instead of scattering it across conditionals.

**Why:** Scattered booleans, repeated shape assumptions, and branching spread across files are accidental complexity. A structure that matches the domain makes invalid states unrepresentable and deletes branches. Choosing it at write time is cheap. Recovering it later reads as a refactor and gets deferred.

**Reach for structures like these:**

- A state machine instead of scattered booleans, phases, or lifecycle checks.
- A typed object/model instead of loose parameters or repeated shape assumptions.
- A map, registry, lookup table, or discriminated union instead of branching spread across files.
- A reducer or command/event model instead of ad hoc state mutations.
- A module organized around one body of domain knowledge instead of a sequence such as load, validate, transform, and save. Execution order is not ownership.
- A small module boundary that gathers repeated behavior, ownership, or invariants.
- A queue, cache, index, graph/tree, or normalized collection where the data access pattern calls for it.
- Any other structure that fits. When none fits, work out what the code must never allow and how the data gets read, then find the structure that encodes exactly that.

Do not force an abstraction. Prefer boring code if the current shape is already clear, local, and unlikely to grow. Be skeptical of an abstraction that adds indirection without removing branches, duplicated rules, invalid states, or lifecycle risk.

The sign that you skipped this is a new feature that grows an existing if/else chain by one more branch, or a second boolean that must stay in sync with the first. Temporal decomposition is another sign. Phase-named modules repeat the same domain rules across steps.

# Type System Discipline

The type checker is a proof assistant. Use it to eliminate impossible states, mismatched primitives, and unhandled variants at compile time. A case the types let you ignore becomes a runtime failure the compiler could have stopped. Prefer defining errors and special cases out of existence over proliferating handlers. Unrepresentable states, total functions, and interface redesign (the patterns below) are the tools.

Applies to any typed language. Skills like `typescript-best-practices` ground it in specific syntax.

**The patterns:**

- **Make illegal states unrepresentable.** Model variants as sum types: discriminated unions in TypeScript, enums with payloads in Rust/Swift/Kotlin, sealed classes in Scala, ADTs in Haskell/OCaml. Don't model state as a bag of optional fields where contradictory combinations compile. A subtle anti-pattern: `{ completed: boolean; completedAt?: Date }` admits `completed: true; completedAt: undefined`, which is meaningless. Derive the boolean from a single source like `completedAt !== null`, or model the variants explicitly as `{ kind: 'open' } | { kind: 'done'; at: Date }`. If a bug forces the question "wait, can this combination actually happen?", the type is too loose.
- **Types are constructions, not restrictions.** Build the type up from the values you want instead of carving them out of a looser type with checks. The invariant that seems to need a refinement type is usually a construction away. A non-empty list is a head plus a rest, not a list with a length check. A valid time range is a start plus a duration, not two timestamps you must keep ordered. No representation is privileged. A list of pairs is an even-length list if you interpret it that way, so choose the shape that cannot build the illegal value and expose the interface callers need on top.
- **Brand semantic primitives.** `UserId` and `OrderId` are strings underneath but should not be interchangeable. Newtypes in Rust, opaque types in Swift, value classes in Kotlin, phantom types in Haskell, branded intersections in TypeScript. Validate once at creation, trust the type downstream.
- **External data is untyped until parsed.** RPC payloads, JSON, IPC messages, CLI args, config files, environment variables, database rows. Have a parse function at every boundary that turns unstructured input into the typed model. See the **boundary-discipline** principle skill for where to put validation.
- **Don't lie to the type system.** Casts, unsafe coercions, and assertion functions that bypass the compiler are latent runtime crashes. If the compiler can't prove a fact, prove it (validate, narrow, refine the model) or accept that the cast is a hazard.
- **Exhaustive matching is the compiler's job.** When you match on a sum type, the compiler must fail compilation if a new variant is added without handling. Use the idiom your language provides: `never`-typed binding in TypeScript, unannotated `match` in Rust, `-Wincomplete-patterns` in Haskell, sealed-class match exhaustiveness in Kotlin.
- **Derive types from authoritative schemas.** When a protocol buffer, OpenAPI spec, GraphQL schema, database migration, or design-system token file defines a shape, derive from it instead of hand-rolling a parallel type. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.
- **Strengthen a type only where partiality appears.** A runtime assertion, null check, or "this should never happen" throw marks the place a type is too weak. Push that check up into the type. Then stop. The type system's job is to track the cases each use site must handle, not to describe the data as precisely as possible. Prefer total functions. `sum` of an empty list is 0, so it takes the plain list. `head` of an empty list has no answer, so it demands the non-empty one.

**The tests:**

- "Can I write a comment explaining when this combination of fields is valid?" If yes, the type is too loose. Split it into a sum type.
- "Do two of my function arguments share a primitive type but mean different things?" Brand them.
- "Where did this `any`, this `as`, this `assertNotNull` come from?" Trace it to the boundary and validate there instead.
- "If a new variant is added next month, will the compiler tell the next agent where to add a case?" If no, the match isn't exhaustive.
- "Is this type duplicating a shape another file owns?" Derive instead.
- "Am I strengthening this type to keep an operation total, or just to be more precise?" If nothing would otherwise panic, keep the plain type.
